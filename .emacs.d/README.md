# Ruby/Rails Emacs configuration

This is my Emacs' configuration for Ruby and Rails, specifically for my workplace at FreeAgent. There shouldn't be any particular things here that you cannot use outside of my workplace development environment. Note, I'm not claiming this is a canonical configuration; it suits me, and contains personal choices that best work with my workflow. Your workflow will be different and so will your config. 

## Getting Started

The files are organised in `site-lisp/` with `init.el` serving as the bootstrap file. The files in `site-list/` are named for the functionality they serve, more or less.

### Prerequisites

This config uses `use-package` which it downloads and configures if not found. This configuration works against `Emacs 26.3` and should work for other versions.

### Installing

Copy the config into your `~/.emacs.d` or just copy and paste whatever snippets you want.
